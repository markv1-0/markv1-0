# Are our staff our greatest security threat or asset?

We’re all clearly aware that end users represent the primary point of ingress for a threat actor into our businesses. Sophisticated spear phishing attacks based upon extensive research and reconnaissance, combined with the clever use of social engineering, only need to succeed in a very small percentage of attempts to give the attacker a foothold from which to expand the scope of their attack.
As business go through digital transformations, embrace increased agility, and provide staffers with new ways of working through multiple channels, the legacy corporate boundary is eroding and the need for trust in the end user is increasing. Staff want to work in their own way, using the technology that they want to use, rather than just being tied to rigidly controlled corporate devices. Companies with a stringent security environment not only inhibit employee productivity and create a drag on digital transformation efforts but may also find that retention and recruitment are impacted.
Which leaves us with a dilemma. We need tight controls over corporate data; however, we understand that, in order to realize the advantages of digital transformation, we have to enable our staff to be productive by providing them with the means to work in the best way for them.  How do we find that delicate balance?
We need to think of security as a key enabler to digital transformation, not an inhibitor. Adopting an information and business centric approach to security is critical. And we need to ensure that as part of this security digital transformation we enable our staff to become a security asset to the business
In order to accomplish this, security has to be easy. We must consider human nature and psychology when we’re designing security architectures. The best security controls are transparent to the user and enable them to work in the most productive way for them. Security awareness training and education only go so far and if staff find that security is difficult or gets in the way, they will go around it
Companies should look at the specific business objective, evaluate the risk and apply security policies in a way that is proportionate to the value of the business process. Companies should also consider concepts like the zero-trust framework in which all devices, processes, end users, even security admins are automatically considered untrusted and must be appropriately authenticated.
There are a host of specific tools that we can deploy, including identity and access management, mobile application management, cloud access security brokers, digital rights management, data leak protection and encryption. In the end, we should be treating our staff as grown-ups and putting these tools and mechanisms in place for them to function securely, without getting in the way of their ability to be productive.
“So, are our staff our greatest security asset or threat?” Arguably they are both and it’s the balance of threat against asset that we need to treat. The more security enables our staff to work productively in as transparent a way as possible, the more the balance moves away from threat towards asset. And the more we make it easy for our staff to work securely, the more securely they will work.
