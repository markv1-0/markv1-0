introduction: |
  Hi and welcome to my site.  This site is a bit of a play-pen for me to experiment with static web sites, Git Pages, Jekyll, etc.

  So let me introduce myself.

  I'm Mark Evans, I work in the IT industry in Cyber Security.  I'm a Security Technologist and Enterprise Security Architect, with a broad experience across multiple industry sectors, but especially strong in Public Sector.  I'm currently focused on security in the context of Digital Transformation and how we ensure that Security enables Digital Transformation.

  I'm currently a Security and Complaince Leader at Amazon Web Services.  For more details of skillset, capabilities, work history and published white papers/articles, take a look at my [CV](cv.html).

  When I'm not doing Cyber Security stuff, I'm a Kayaker, Hill/Mountain Walker, Climber, Skier!
